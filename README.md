# DEEP-LEARNING-WITH-COVID-19-XRAY-CONVOLUTED-NEURAL-NETWORK

## [Disclaimer: Please note that this project is not scientifically tested or prepared for use in any other setting than a personal project.]

### I decided to take on the project of identifying whether X-ray imagery of lungs contained COVID-19 virus or were healthy. Through doing this I was able to study various types of convolutional neural networks, image classification, and real world example of model analysis and where shortcomings working with real problems.

I treated this project as a learning process, and while making my own decisions about what to implement ultimately, I did find the following articles to be very educational and guide me in the right directions.
